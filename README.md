# HC-SR04 with LabView
In this project, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor will be used to solve the porpoising problem of Formula 1 teams in their cars.
## Problem:
In aerodynamics, the faster the car accelerates, the greater the downforce produced by the car. With the increase in the downforce, the distance between the car and the ground decreases and eventually the distance becomes zero. With the distance being zero, the air flow behind the car becomes zero. The fact that the air flow under the car is zero causes the downforce to reset momentarily. This downforce reset causes bouncing on the car. After the bounce, there will be air flow under the car again, so downforce occurs again, and this process becomes a cycle.

This cycle is called **"Porpoising"**. Porpoising decreases speed at the straight lines of the cars and makes them more unbalanced and unstable. Also it exhausts drivers physically and prevents them from focusing. 

## Solution:
It was stated that the main cause of the porpoising problem was the cessation of airflow under the car. This problem can be solved with an active suspension. Active suspensions are suspensions with variable stiffness and angle. If the stiffness can be adjusted on the suspension with the help of a sensor, the car can be prevented from touching the ground and thus the air flow under the car can be prevented from disappearing. In this way, the problem of porpoising can be eliminated. The sensor to be used to solve this problem is the **HC-SR04** ultrasonic distance sensor, which will measure the distance between the car and the ground.
